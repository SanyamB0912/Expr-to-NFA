# Expr-to-NFA

This project focuses on converting regular expressions into Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA), a fundamental concept in automata theory and formal languages. This project is designed to take any given regular expression as input and translate it into a graphical representation that illustrates states, transitions, and input symbols. By parsing the expression, constructing the NFA, generating a transition table, and offering visualization capabilities, this project is a valuable tool for understanding and working with regular expressions in pattern matching and string processing.
